# Contact Book
Syntriq Internship Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Contact Book application developed using Python. 
It allows users to manage contact information efficiently through a structured menu-driven system.

Users can add, view, search, update, and delete contacts within a single session.

## Core Functionalities
- Add a new contact with name, phone number, email, and address
- View all saved contacts in a structured format
- Search contacts by name or phone number
- Update existing contact details
- Delete a contact using phone number
- Simple and interactive menu-based navigation

## Program Structure
The application is organized using separate functions for better clarity and maintainability:
- `show_menu()` displays available options
- `add_contact()` adds new contact details
- `view_contacts()` shows all saved contacts
- `search_contact()` finds matching contacts
- `update_contact()` modifies contact information
- `delete_contact()` removes a contact
- `main()` controls the overall program flow

Contacts are stored in a list of dictionaries during program execution.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Lists and Dictionaries (Data Structures)

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Python on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open the project folder in Command Prompt or Terminal.
4. Run the following command:

   python ContactBook.py

5. Choose options from the menu to manage contacts.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Function-based program design
- Working with lists and dictionaries
- Implementing search, update, and delete operations
- Building structured CLI applications
- Writing modular and readable code
