Syntriq Internship Project

## Project Overview
This project is a console-based Password Generator developed using Python. 
It generates a random password based on the length provided by the user.

The application ensures basic password strength by combining letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Features

- random module

## How the Program Works
1. The user is asked to enter the desired password length.
2. The program checks if the length is at least 6.
3. If invalid input is entered, the program handles the error gracefully.
